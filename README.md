# Hangman!

For a crash course at The Iron Yard Durham, I implemented the classic game with the attendees.

This repo contains the file itself which walks through some Python fundamentals and moves on to the actual script.

## Prerequisites 

[python3](https://python.com.org) - the programming language used

## Installing

Simply clone or download this repo or the hangman.py file itself.

With Python installed, from the directory with the hangman.py, run:

```
python3 hangman.py
```

Enjoy!
